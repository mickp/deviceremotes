Microscope is a Python framework for the control of microscope devices
and management of microscopy experiments.

The aim of this project is to create a generic open source microscope
control package. The plan is to have two separable components, one to
drive the microscope and a second gui front end. The microscope
driving component will be fully scriptable and not reliant on the gui
for its functionality, but the gui will implement a flexible and
powerful front end for microscope users.
