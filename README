Python's microscope package is a free and open source framework for:

* control of local and remote microscope devices
* aggregation of microscope devices into complex microscopes
* automate microscope experiments

It is aimed at those that are building their own microscopes, or need
programmatic control for microscope experiments.

This package does *not* provide a graphical user interface that a
typical microscope user would expect.  Instead, it provides the
foundation over which such interfaces can be built.

For a microscope graphical user interface, consider the sister project
`microscope cockpit <https://github.com/MicronOxford/cockpit>`_.
